2)      Select  file ‡ New ‡ Give the name for the database as   eCAF_DB  (DBTest.mdb) and save it in the C:\ eCAF  location . 
II)                  To Create the Datasource in ODBC driver.    

                1 )     click start ‡ control panel ‡administrative tools‡Data sources(ODBC).

3)       A Dialog box named ODBC data source administrator will be opened.
                 4)     Click the tab User DSN. 
                 5)     In that ,click the add button, a dialog box named Create a new data source will be opened, in that select the desired driver(ex. MS access Driver)
                6)     The ODBC MS access driver setup dialog box will be opened , in that  click the select button and browse   the location of  database  eCAF_DB  as C:\ eCAF \ eCAF_DB .mdb   (F:\Eclipse\Database\DBTest.mdb) and set the data source name UnifyDS  (MyTestDS) and then click finish.
               7)     Now you can see  the data source name added to the User DSN ,then click ok to close that dialog box.

Now that data source is created and the database also created in your machine is added to that data source in the ODBC driver.
